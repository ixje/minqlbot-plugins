minqlbot-plugins
================

All credits go to the original author Mino. Without his work on [minqlbot](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlbot) there would be no place for plugins.

For the latest version of the original plugins including bux fixes visit the [original plugins repository](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlbot-plugins)

What new in this branch
=======================

**leveller.py** - a standalone plugin that auto levels out teams by spectating the last joiner and/or lowest score on the oversized team

### Status
Broken. Not functional in it's current state.

### TODO
* Make a more intelligent ruling system by tracking team join time and score
* Slap Thaya to finish it
* remove work around for game_start/round_start bug. Should be fixed in the mainbot by now.

Installation
============
Copy `leveller.py` to your plugins directory and add *leveller* to the plugins list in your `config.cfg`.
