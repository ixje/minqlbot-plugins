minqlbot-plugins
================

All credits go to the original author Mino. Without his work on [minqlbot](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlbot) there would be no place for plugins.

For the latest version of the original plugins including bux fixes visit the [original plugins repository](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlbot-plugins)

What is this fork about?
========================

Here I publish plugins that extend or modify the base functionality of the administrator bot to my likings. Have a look at the table in the plugins section and see if find something you like as well.

### So many branches, whyyy?
I like to work on plugins in total isolation. 

Plugins
=======
The plugins in the table below can be found in this repo. You can navigate to them by following the links in the table or by manually changing the branch near the top of the page. Each plugin has it's own detailed description regarding functionality and installation instructions.

|Branch|Status|Type|Description|
---------------------------
|[Majority vote balancing](https://github.com/ixje/minqlbot-plugins/tree/balance_majority_voting)|Tested|Modification|Added majority voting by configurable threshold and various tweaks|
|[locker](https://github.com/ixje/minqlbot-plugins/tree/locker)|Experimental|Extension|Auto team (un)locking based on rules|
|[leveller](https://github.com/ixje/minqlbot-plugins/tree/leveller)|Broken|Extension| Auto spectating last joiner/lowest score on unequal teams|


Note: the master branch has no modifications besides this readme file  because apparently you're automatically redicted to the master branch when clicking a fork.
